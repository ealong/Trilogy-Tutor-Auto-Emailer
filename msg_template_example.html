<p>Hi $name!</p>

<p>Thank you for scheduling your session with me. I am looking forward to our session on <b>$date, $starttime - $endtime</b>.</p>

<p>If something comes up and the scheduled time will not work, <b>let me know a minimum of 6 hours before the appointment time</b> and we’ll figure something out.</p>

<p>This session will take place here: $zoomlink</p>

<div style="padding-left: 2em;">(If you have not used zoom before please join the meeting at least 15 minutes early because it may have you download and install some software.)</div><br>
 
Again, all I need from you:
	<ul>
		<li>Be on Tutors & Students Slack 5 minutes before your time slot.</li>

		<li>Make sure your computer/mic/internet connection are working.</li>

		<li>Make sure your workspace is quiet and free from interruptions.</li>

		<li>At the end of the session, I will provide you with a link to a 2 minute evaluation form that you are required to complete.</li>
	</ul>

<p>Slack or email me with any questions. I’m looking forward to our meeting!</p>

<p><b>Please Reply All to this email so that I know you have seen it.</b></p>
